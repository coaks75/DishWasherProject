# DishWasherProject

This project is a simple and fun project that I created for my mom. My mom always yells that no one in my house empies the dishwasher when its clean, loads it when its empty, or runs it when its dirty. I made a fun fix for that using an Arduino, a breadboard, an lcd screen, and an arcade style dome push button, and lots of wires(not really though). All that this project does is cycle between saying "Dishwasher is dirty", "Dishwasher is running", and "Dishwasher is clean, empty it". It works by pressing the button to change what the screen displays. It has a timing aspect to it as well where when you say the dishwasher is running, after the allotted time(that you set in the code) it will automatically switch to the next display. This is my first real Arduino project and I enjoyed doing it as it was fun to learn all of this and to give something fun to my mom.
